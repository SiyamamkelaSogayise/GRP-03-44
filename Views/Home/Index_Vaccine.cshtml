        <h1>WELCOME TO VACCINATION</h1>
        <h2>The first step towards booting your health and your dependents</h2>

        <h3>For Children </h3>
        <p>
            Vaccinating children is one of the most effective ways to protect them from serious and sometimes life-threatening diseases.
            Childhood vaccines not only shield your child from illnesses, but they also contribute to community immunity,
            safeguarding those who are unable to get vaccinated due to health issues.Common childhood vaccines include but are not limited to:
            <ol>

                <li>Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR): Protects against highly contagious diseases that can lead to severe complications, including brain damage and deafness.</li>

                <li>Polio: Prevents a crippling disease that can lead to paralysis and death.</li>

                <li>Hepatitis B: Guards against a liver infection that can cause chronic illness and even liver cancer.</li>

                <li>Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP/Tdap): Prevents severe respiratory infections and neurologic complications.</li>

                <li>Varicella (Chickenpox): Shields against a contagious disease that can lead to severe skin infections and complications.</li>

                <li>Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib): Prevents bacterial infections that can cause serious illnesses like meningitis.</li>
            </ol>


        </p>
        <h3>For Adults</h3>
        <p>
            Vaccination isn't just for kids; it's equally important for adults to stay up-to-date with their immunizations.
            As we age, our immune systems may weaken, making us more vulnerable to infections.
            Some key vaccines for adults include:
            <ol>
                <li>Influenza (Flu): An annual vaccine that protects against a contagious respiratory illness that can lead to severe illness and even death, especially among older adults.</li>

                <li>Pneumococcal: Protects against bacterial infections that can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections.</li>

                <li>Shingles (Herpes Zoster): Guards against a painful and potentially debilitating skin rash caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox.</li>

                <li>Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap/Td): A booster vaccine that helps maintain protection against these diseases.</li>

                <li>Hepatitis A and B: Especially important for those at risk due to travel, medical conditions, or lifestyle choices.</li>

                <li>Human Papillomavirus (HPV): For both men and women, this vaccine prevents certain types of cancers caused by HPV infections.</li>
            </ol>
